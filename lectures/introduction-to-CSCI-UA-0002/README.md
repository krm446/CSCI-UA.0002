## Introduction to CSCI-UA-0002

###House rules
  Please refer to the [departmental syllabus](http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/fall14/CSCI-UA.0002-004/common_syllabus/) and the "main" [README](https://github.com/sssyed/CSCI-UA.0002) for important dates, grading information and general class info.
  If possible - __please__ bring your computer to every lecture.

###Github  
-  You've probably noticed that this course site looks a little different from other course sites you've seen before. That's because we're using a service called `github`, it's a `code` repository service. What that means superficially is that github is a place to store your code. This class repository is hosted on github under the [MIT License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).
-  Github also provides a host of social networking tools that I hope to introduce in this class. Hopefully this will facilitate class discussions and general sharing of knowledge.

###Instructor
- I'm an artist, educator, and self identified software engineer. I founded an independent videogame gallery called __Babycastles__. I've helped produce work that's been shown at [the Hayden Planetarium](http://vimeo.com/35619973), [Museum of Arts and Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpYQ-N__zQo), and sometimes I talk about [games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0ERL20lr1U).
- I currently work at company called [littleBits](http://littlebits.cc/cloud) on their cloud platform. We'll be playing around the "cloudBit" and see what we can program it to do in class
- I love the `internet` and `distributed systems`, i'll be using both as a constant inspiration for content in this course.
- I'm also heavily interested in the `language` part in `computer programming language`. I'll be referencing ideas about `programming languages` from [composing programs](http://composingprograms.com/) time to time.
